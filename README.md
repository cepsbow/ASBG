# ASBG
A Simple Battle Game
Utilizes pure C++ and compiled with GCC 4.9.2 with -O2 -nowallopts
This is a game I developed during my C++ class for fun, and to explain a few concepts that were untouched upon by my programming professor. It was intended to be a tutorial to using classes and objects to create a simple game. This project is fairly well documented as a result.
